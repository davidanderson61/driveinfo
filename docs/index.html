    <h6>The macOS driveinfo Command
    </h6>
    <p>Last Web page update: 2/1/2020, referencing driveinfo version 1.0.4</p>
    <p>
        The <a href="driveinfo.html">driveinfo man page</a> provides most of the information
        needed to use this command. There also is a
        <a href="driveinfo_html.html">HTML version of the man page</a> which auto wraps the text.
        This page discusses addition information not contained in either man page.
    </p>
    <p>
        A summary, including key features of driveinfo, can be found at the 
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/driveinfo/">SourceForge driveinfo homepage</a>.
        The releases of driveinfo can be found at the
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/driveinfo/files/">SourceForge driveinfo files page</a>.
        An automatic download of the latest release can be started by accessing this
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/driveinfo/files/latest/download">SourceForge download link</a>.
        The driveinfo download is in the form a zip file.
        This file is automatically expanded to create a folder.
        The download does not automatically install.
        The driveinfo command does not need to be installed before using.
        Assuming the zip file was downloaded to the
        <span class="code">~/Downloads</span> folder,
        driveinfo can be run by typing the following command along with the desired parameters.
    </p>
    <h5>~/Downloads/driveinfo-1.0.4/driveinfo</h5>
    <p>
        If you wish to install, then enter the following. This will install both the command
        and the corresponding man page.
    </p>
    <h5>sudo ~/Downloads/driveinfo-1.0.4/driveinfo -zcp</h5>
    <p>After installing, the follow files should have been created or verified.</p>
    <h5>/usr/local/bin/driveinfo<br />
        /usr/local/share/man/man8/driveinfo.8<br />
    </h5>
    <p>The following commands can be used to uninstall driveinfo.</p>
    <h5>sudo rm /usr/local/bin/driveinfo<br />
        sudo rm /usr/local/share/man/man8/driveinfo.8<br />
        sudo rm -f /usr/local/share/man/whatis<br />
        sudo /usr/libexec/makewhatis /usr/local/share/man
    </h5>
    <p>
        The driveinfo command is a bash script. This script verifies itself
        by performing a 32 bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC32).
        If modifications are made to the script, then an error message
        with the new CRC32 value will be produced.
        This error message can be eliminated by using the <span class="code">i</span>
        option or replacing the CRC32 value at the end of the script.
        The <span class="code">i</span> option can also be placed in the DRIVEINFO_OPTIONS
        environment variable.
    </p>
    <p>
        The driveinfo source git repository contains the script files <span class="code">driveinfo</span>,
        <span class="code">math</span> and <span class="code">help</span>. Both the
        <span class="code">math</span> and <span class="code">help</span> files are merged into
        the <span class="code">driveinfo</span> file to create the released single
        <span class="code">driveinfo</span> file. The git repository can be accessed from either
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/driveinfo/code/ci/master/tree/">SourceForge</a> or 
        <a href="https://github.com/davidanderson61/driveinfo">GitHub</a>.
