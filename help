.Sh NAME
.Nm $application
.Nd "provide partition information for GPT drives"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl A
.Op Fl R Ar options-to-reset 
.Op Fl a Ar byte-alignment 
.Op Fl b 
.Op Fl c Ar column-list 
.Op Fl defhimprs 
.Op Fl t Ar maximum-entries 
.Op Fl vx 
.Op Fl z Ar file-list 
.Op Fl - 
.Op Ar device 
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command gets detailed information about a specific drive.
The script parses property lists emitted by the
.Xr diskutil 8
command to
compile the information. If the drive contains a GUID Partition Table
(GPT), then detailed information about each partition is also included in
a tabular form. This also allows free space on a drive, using a GPT, to be
identified.
.Pp
The
.Xr gpt 8
command can be used to view the actual stored GPT values in in a
tabular form. Starting with macOS, the
.Xr gpt 8
command can no longer read the
GPT on an operating system boot drive, unless System Integrity Protection
(SIP) is disabled. The
.Nm
command does not require disabling SIP
and can produce the same basic tabular output as the
.Xr gpt 8 
command.
.Pp
The options are applied as read from left to right and are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.\" ==========
.It Fl A
Reset to the default all options. This option is the same as entering
the
.Fl R Ar abcdefimrstx
option.
.\" ==========
.It Fl R Ar options-to-reset
Reset to the default value any options given as the argument.
.\" ==========
.It Fl a Ar byte-alignment
Set the byte alignment value used to determine if the "A" and "S"
error codes should be issued. The default is to never issue either
code. Normally, the byte alignment value should be a power of 2
greater than the logical sector size.
.\" ==========
.It Fl b
Display blocks instead of bytes. Each block is equal to the logical
sector size in bytes.
.\" ==========
.It Fl c Ar column-list
Specify which columns to display. Each character in the argument
represents a column type. The list of possible column types is given
in the COLUMNS section. The default is to display the "$DefaultColumns"
column types.
.\" ==========
.It Fl d
Omit the header.
.\" ==========
.It Fl e
Omit the table.
.\" ==========
.It Fl f
Force use of color. Color sequences are normally disabled if the
output is not directed to a terminal. This can be overridden by
setting this flag.
.\" ==========
.It Fl h
Display this help text, then quit. All previous options are ignored.
.\" ==========
.It Fl i
Do not validate the source script. This option must occur before any
other options both on the command line and in the ${APPLICATION}_OPTIONS
environment variable, otherwise this option will be ignored.
.\" ==========
.It Fl m
Omit thousands separator.
.\" ==========
.It Fl p
Pipe the help text to the less command, then quit. All previous
options are ignored. This allows the help text to be viewed
interactively.
.\" ==========
.It Fl r
Enable colorized output. ANSI escape codes are used to highlight free
space and entries with error codes. No attempt is made to determine
if the ANSI escape codes are compatible with the current terminal.
.\" ==========
.It Fl s
Display execution times. This option is for diagnostic purposes.
.\" ==========
.It Fl t Ar maximum-entries
Set the maximum number of partition entries allowed in GPT. This
option should not be used unless the user knows the GPT was created
with more than the default of 128 possible entries.
.\" ==========
.It Fl v
Display the version, then quit.  All previous options are ignored.
.\" ==========
.It Fl x
Add a metric prefix to the values.
.\" ==========
.It Fl z Ar file-list
Install the files associated with this command, then quit. All previous
options are ignored. Each character in the argument represents a file
type. The list of possible file types is given in the FILES section.
.\" ==========
.It Fl -
Signals the end of options and disables further option processing.

.Sh DEVICES
A device parameter can usually be any of the following:
.Bl -bullet 
.It
The
.Sy disk identifier
(see below) of a drive with a GPT. Any entry of the form of
.Pa diskU ,
where U is zero or a positive decimal integer, e.g.
.Pa disk0 .
.It
The device node entry containing the
.Sy disk identifier
of a drive with a
GPT.  Any entry of the form of
.Pa /dev/[r]diskU ,
where U is zero or a positive decimal integer, e.g.
.Pa /dev/disk0 .
.El
.Pp
Further information about devices can be found on the man page
for
.Xr diskutil 8 .
.Sh DISK IDENTIFIER
The (BSD)
.Sy disk identifier
string variously identifies a physical or
logical device unit, a session (if any) upon that device, a slice
(partition) upon that session (if any), or a virtual logical volume. In
the context of this command, a
.Sy disk identifier
may take the form of
.Pa diskU
or
.Pa diskUsS ,
where:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Pa U
is the device unit represented by zero or a positive decimal
integer (possibly multi-digit). It may refer to hardware (e.g. a hard
drive, optical drive, or memory card) or a virtual "drive" constructed
by software (e.g. an AppleRAID Set, disk image, CoreStorage LV, etc.).
.It
.Pa S
is the slice (partition) represented by a positive decimal integer
(possibly multi-digit). Upon this partition, the raw data that
underlies a user-visible file system is usually present, but it may
also contain specialized data for certain 3rd-party database programs,
or data required for the system software (e.g. EFI partitions, booter
partitions, APM partition map data, etc.), or, notably, it might
contain backing-store physical volumes for AppleRAID, CoreStorage,
APFS, or 3rd-party Storage Systems.
.El
.Pp
.\" .Bl -column ".hi" ".12345678901" "Either "Yes" for a mounted partition, otherwise "No"."
Further information about
.Sy disk identifiers
can be found on the man page
for
.Xr diskutil 8 .

.It i\ \ \ Identifier:
Disk identifier of the partition (slice).
.It m\ \ \ Mounted:
Either "Yes" for a mounted partition, otherwise "No".
.It n\ \ \ Name:
Known or last known volume label.
.It p\ \ \ Personality:

.Sh ERROR CODES
These letters may appear in the "Code" column.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 2n
.It A
The "Begin" value is not a multiple of the byte-alignment value. This
check only performed on partition entries.
.It I
One or more values are invalid. A value is invalid, if at least one
of the three following conditions occurs. First, the "Begin" value is
greater than the "End" value. Second, the "Begin" block value is
greater than or equal to the number of sectors. Third, the "End" block
value is greater than or equal to the number of sectors.
.It O
The entry overlaps another entry. There is overlap, if at least one of
the two following conditions occurs. First, the "End" value is greater
than or equal to the "Begin" value of the next entry. Second, the
entry is not last and the "Begin" value greater than the "End" value.
.It S
The "Size" value is not a multiple of the byte-alignment value. This
check only performed on partition entries.
.El
.Sh COLORS
.Bl -tag -compact -width 6n
.It Red
The entry contains one or more error codes.
.It Green
The entry represents free space on the drive.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable affects the execution of
.Nm :
.Pp
${APPLICATION}_OPTIONS
.Pp
If the ${APPLICATION}_OPTIONS variable exists in the environment, then the
options are read from this variable, before reading any additional options
from the command line.
.Pp
${APPLICATION}_INCLUDE
.Pp
.\"45678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
The ${APPLICATION}_INCLUDE variable is only used during code development. Under
normal usage, this variable is not accessed and can therefore be ignored. If
the ${APPLICATION}_INCLUDE variable exists in the environment during code
devolopment, then the directory stored in this variable may be searched for
include files. 
.Sh FILES
The letters given below may appear as the argument to the z option. This
option installs the
.Nm
command into macOS. Note: Any existing files will be replaced.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 2n
.It c
Copy the bash script to the
.Pa /usr/local/bin/$application
file.
.\"
.\"No check is made to determine if the
.\".Pa /usr/local/bin
.\"directory is included in the PATH environment variable. Further information
.\"about the PATH environment variable can be found on the man page for
.\".Xr bash 1 .
.\"
.It p
Write the man page to the
.Pa /usr/local/share/man/man8/$application.8
file. 
.\"
.\"No check is made to determine if the
.\".Pa /usr/local/share/man
.\"directory is included in the MANPATH environment variable.
.\"Further information about the MANPATH environment variable can be found on
.\"the man page for
.\".Xr man 1 .
.\"
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl $application disk0
If the ${APPLICATION}_OPTIONS variable is defined, then the options are read
from this variable before displaying the information for disk0.
.Pp
.Dl $application -A disk0
Ignore the ${APPLICATION}_OPTIONS variable and display the default information
for disk0.
.Pp
.Dl $application -Abdmc bsit /dev/disk0
Replacement for the "sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0" command.
.Pp
.Dl $application -a 4096 -r disk0
Determine if the "A" and "S" error codes should be issued for partition
entries. The argument value of 4096 bytes is the alignment requirment for
proper operation of Apple_APFS, Apple_Boot, Apple_CoreStorage and
Apple_HFS partitions.
.Pp
.Dl $application -r disk0
Use color to highlight free space and entries with error codes.
.Pp
.Dl $application -R bd disk0
Reset b and d options, if specified in the ${APPLICATION}_OPTIONS variable.
.Pp
.Dl $application -z cp
Install this command. See the FILES section for more information.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Problems found with entries in (GPT) are flagged by letters appearing in the
"Code" column of the table.
.Pp
The s option can be used to determine the execution times of the script. This
options verifies that a majority of the time is spent waiting for the
.Xr diskutil 8
command to return property lists.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
At the time of this writing,
.Nm
found to be compatible with High Sierra (macOS 10.13) and newer versions of macOS.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
An value of 0 is returned to indicate success. A value of 2 is returned,
if the script determines a error condition. Otherwise, any exit code,
found in a
.Xr diskutil 8
property list, will be the returned exit status of
the script.
.Sh VALIDATION
Normally, a CRC32 validation is preformed on the source script. This can
be disabled with the i option. If the script is deliberately modified,
then the hexadecimal value given in the error message should be used to
replace the value at the end of the script. This value should be followed
by a newline.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr diskutil 8 ,
.Xr gpt 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility is not part of macOS. The first downloadable version
appeared in December of 2018.
.Sh VERSION
This documentation is current for version $(Version) of
.Nm .
.Sh BUGS
The tabular information is only produced for drives with a GPT.
.Pp
The default maximum number of partition entries allowed in GPT is assumed
to be 128. While this is a fairly safe assumption, if the actual value is
different, then this utility will not know unless set by the t option.
